81.91	83.7	All right. 
83.7	88.57	Does Anyone have anything they want to discuss this week. 
88.57	93.88	<empty>
93.88	99.19	<empty>
99.19	101.86	If we're looking for topics. 
101.86	104.53	That we are. 
104.53	106.76	I don't know. 
106.76	109.43	If anyone ended up investigating. 
109.43	111.66	The memory consumption thing. 
111.66	113.89	Because. 
113.89	120.08	From yesterday. I think it was happening before. Because that reminded me. 
120.08	123.19	If I finally finished. 
123.19	125.86	The new version. 
125.86	128.09	Of the tool. 
128.09	132.08	I've been kind of responsible for a while now. 
132.08	132.99	It has. 
132.99	137.86	The Observer. 
137.86	140.53	Or like htop, like. 
140.53	148.04	Interface for investigating like the memory consumption both like the atom tables and everything else. And like. 
148.04	148.95	Per. 
148.95	154.7	Process stuff. So if we ever end up in a position where it needs investigation. 
154.7	164.85	If I bring it to production ready, we could use that just kind of flagging it up. And I don't know how much of a problem the memory consumption thing is for now for us. 
164.85	171.04	Yeah. I'd be really interested in seeing how it looks. 
171.04	174.59	Let's just see how we're doing right now anyway. 
174.59	178.14	We got three nodes still up, though. 
178.14	185.65	I think we're kind of normal for today. We had a bit of a cpu spike as well. 
185.65	194.92	Yeah. We didn't get time to dive in to figure out what was actually triggering it. 
194.92	198.03	Maybe we can spin by two nodes. 
198.03	205.98	And keep an eye on things for tomorrow. Well, I'll leave it for now because we're kind of, like, busy part of the day. 
205.98	214.81	But maybe in the morning, let's bring it back down to two. And then if we see another spike, we can dig in. 
214.81	221.0	If you have any more information. 
221.0	222.79	About. 
222.79	224.58	This tool. 
224.58	226.37	Maybe you could share that. 
226.37	230.8	Finish some work. I was kind of looking. 
230.8	237.87	If it's ready, but I had some unexpected errors and whatever. So maybe I can say like, okay, if you want to investigate and can wait a week. 
237.87	243.62	I'm going to get stuff ready for in a week and I also still don't have access to. 
243.62	247.61	Prod machines to kind of ssh. 
247.61	251.16	And open the electric console there. So. 
251.16	254.27	I can't do anything hands on yet. 
254.27	255.62	So. 
255.62	260.93	Let's wait. Okay. Yeah. I think it's like we still have. 
260.93	264.48	Basic tooling around telling this stuff. 
264.48	266.71	Like you use the built in. 
266.71	273.34	Erlang process info to get information about memory and reductions. 
273.34	276.01	It's not always. 
276.01	280.44	Fruitful, in terms of these debugging. 
280.44	284.87	Memory is a little easier to track because. 
284.87	289.3	You're just taking it from memory of a cpu. It seems to. 
289.3	296.37	Moving targets. It's very hard to kind of figure out what's eating it. 
296.37	297.72	Yeah. 
297.72	306.55	We can ship for sure. Wait for that. Especially if it's something you're doing in your free time. 
306.55	311.86	Okay. I don't have much to contribute right now. 
311.86	315.85	But I just wanted to fill the sale, okay. 
315.85	319.84	Anyone have anything else. 
319.84	324.71	I don't have anything. 
324.71	333.54	After me getting the taxi to the airport because the bus didn't come rushing to the airport. My flight was toyed for two and a half hours. 
333.54	336.65	I didn't get home until 130 in the morning. 
336.65	340.64	So it has to be the most probable days. 
340.64	343.31	But things happen. 
343.31	346.86	But we can leave it there for today. Then if we have nothing else. 
346.86	349.97	Enjoy your 25 minutes back.
