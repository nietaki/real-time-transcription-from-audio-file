Simplest repro of AssemblyAI live transcription and its timestamps

We're using a wav file generated from one of our meeting recordings

## Setup

On a Mac, using `rtx` to manage python. You have to have `ffmpeg` installed

```
./setup.sh
```

Make sure to set up your AssemblyAI credentials in `configure.py`

## How to use the script to debug the AssemblyAI real-time transcriptions

Setup the deps using the setup script.

Pick an audio/video file and transcode it to the expected format

```bash
$ ./transcode.bash some_video.mp4 output.wav
```

Configure your AssemblyAI API key in the `configure.py` file (see `configure.py.example` for reference.

Obtain the utterance and word transcription time bounds from the AssemblyAI real-time transcription API

```bash
$ python3 speech_recognition.py output.wav label:utterance utterances.txt
$ python3 speech_recognition.py output.wav label:word words.txt
```

Use Audacity to compare the audio and its waveform to timestamps generated by AssemblyAI: Open the audio file in Audacity and import the text files as labels (`File -> Import -> Labels`)

You should get a result similar to the following:

You'll see that while the returned utterance bounds are mostly correct, the timestamps for the beginnings of words are delayed - "late" by usually between 350 - 1500ms.

**NOTE:** This seems to be especially true for words at the beginnings of utterances - the words within an utterance seem "squished together" in time, within the utterance, so the first ones are the most affected.

## The impact of buffer size on the transcription

Not really noticeable - see below:

From the recall bot session used to record this call we got the following timestamps:

## Results 

Here are some key things I noticed (from the above screenshot and in general):

The AssemblyAI transcript chunks can have their **start timestamps** a bit too late, compared to the real audio file, but it's usually relatively accurate

The AssemblyAI transcript chunks usually have their **end timestamps** noticeably late - the chunks usually contain either a period of silence at the end, or even slightly overlap with the beginning of the next utterance. **Usually** the bulk of the information from the audio slice is **at the beginning of it** - closer to the start than to the end.

Recall returns the timestamps of individual words, from the chunks streaming from AssemblyAI. It seems like it runs a heuristic, where it assumes the information is located roughly in the middle of a chunk returned from AssemblyAI and leaves segments of silence at the beginning and end of the utterance. It also seems to add more silence in the beginning than in the end.

This leads to the timestamps being "compressed" in time (grouped more tightly together) but also on average moved forward in time. 

The beginnings of utterances are affected the most - they're sometimes shifted forward by a couple of seconds
